Introduction:

This project is a simple implementation of a URL shortener, developed as part of our programming class. The objective was to apply basic programming concepts to create a functional and efficient tool for shortening long URLs.

Features:

URL Shortening: The main functionality of the tool is to shorten long URLs, making them more manageable and shareable.

Customizable Short URLs: Users can choose a custom alias for their shortened URL, making it easy to remember and share.

Error Handling: The system is equipped with error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid URLs, custom aliases, and other potential issues.

Concepts Applied from Class:

Functions: The core functionalities of shortening URLs, customizing aliases, and tracking access are implemented as separate functions for better code organization.

Dictionaries: Dictionaries are used to store the mapping between custom aliases and original URLs, as well as to track access counts.

Conditional Statements: Conditions are employed to handle errors, check for the existence of custom aliases, and control the flow of the program.

File Handling: The tool may use file handling to store and retrieve data, ensuring persistence of custom aliases and access counts even after restarting the program.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Run the sURL shortener in your Python environment.

Choose to shorten a URL, an existing one.

Follow the on-screen instructions to input the necessary information.

The tool will provide you with the shortened URL or relevant information based on your chosen action.
